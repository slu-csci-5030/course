# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

In software development, we follow a structured path called the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

**Planning:** Set project goals, timelines, and resources.
**Design:** Create a detailed plan for system architecture.
**Implementation (Coding):** Write the actual code based on the design.
**Testing:** Ensure the software meets requirements and is bug-free.
**Deployment:** Release the software for use.
**Maintenance:** Address bugs and enhance features over time.

# System Architecture and Diagrams

## System Architecture

Think of system architecture as a blueprint. Common types include:
**Monolithic Architecture:** All-in-one application.
**Microservices Architecture:** Breaks down into small, independent services.
**Client-Server Architecture:** Splits client and server components.

## Diagrams

Visualize with diagrams like UML, flowcharts, and deployment diagrams.
