# Karthik Mangineni, in this class, I have learned about values in software development. These values are the key to success in development, satisfying client requirements. I have also gained knowledge about different methodologies such as Waterfall, Agile, and some strategic approaches for the development of systems, incorporating both planned and dynamic strategies.
