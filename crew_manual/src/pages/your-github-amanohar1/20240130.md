In our second and third week of the class focusing on architecture designs and prototypes, we got into a really interesting activity where we brainstormed different design ideas and then actually made three different paper prototypes of the same screen to test out our concepts. This was pretty cool because it let us see our ideas in a more concrete way, and by sharing our designs with classmates, we could figure out what worked well and what didn't. It was all about trying out our thoughts quickly and learning from the process, and then getting rid of the ideas that didn't make the cut. This way of testing and improving our designs is going to help us a lot as we have 13 more weeks to get our projects just right.
