In weeks 1 and 2, we've formed the teams by discussing the "Project Briefings" for modules "Why" and "What" by evaluating the purpose of the mission, underlying principles, and norms.

By discussing the principles of values, value proposition, and some queries (product questions, customer questions, enterprise questions, and customer questions). Certain principles discussed matriculate the purpose of building these projects :
  1. Research Asset Discovery
  2. Just a Second Connector
  3. Material Donor Mutual Assist

Also, the additional resources given drove us to learn the concepts of:
  1. The Surprising Power of Questions
  2. Learn how to ask good questions to keep the conversation going
  3. 4 Tips For Asking Better Questions In Product Design Research
  4. Empathy - what, why, what for used, basics, why is it needed in Design Thinking
