# Reflection
The first module explains the significance of "value" in software development. Software development generally targets creating some value for the customer or client. Value can be anything, sometimes it is just a reduction in manual effort, or in some cases, it is in financial terms. The first modules also covered project briefings, which gave an overview of what the client was expecting from it. It may not be a detailed requirement document but good enough to understand the problems that are facing the client and for us to think about what application can we come up with to address this problem. 

In the second module, SDLC, architecture, and prototypes are covered. Though I have a good idea of SDLC, agile, and waterfall methodologies, there were a lot of new things to learn. I understood clearly what are the Agile principles that have to be followed.

Overall, both the modules gave me a very good intro to the class, and have a lot to learn from.
