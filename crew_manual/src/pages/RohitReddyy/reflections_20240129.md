# Reflections on work done so far in Principles of Software Development

## Week-1: 

* **Introduction:**
    We had a brief introduction of the course, the outcomes of the course, and also of our professor Daniel Shown. 

* **Course Main Goal:**
    The main goal of this course is to provide us a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts, procedures and approaches involved in software development. This includes many topics like Software development Like cycle, Software Engineering Principles,Software Design and Architecture, Software Development Methodologies like waterfall, agile etc. and some key concepts like scrum, kanban.

* **Final Objective:**
    The final objective of the course is to deliver software that has been prepared and tested by us to our customers. 

* **Project Briefings:**
    We had three really interesting projects to work on: Research Asset Discovery, Just a Second Chance Connector, and Material Donor Mutual Assist. During a session with the customers, they shared their expectations with us

## Week-2: 

* **SDLC:**
    We were given breif introduction about the Software Development Life cycle which encompasses various phases like planning, requirement gathering, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. We were given insights into each phase.

* **Architecture and tech stacks:**
    An overview of tech stacks and architectural concepts was given to us. We explored different architectures, analyzing their respective advantges and disadvantages. Each architecture provides a different perspective.

## Overall Reflections

In summary, the first two weeks of the course have provided a solid foundation for our journey in software development. With a clear understanding of course objectives, active engagement in projects, and a commitment to continuous improvement, we're prepared to take on the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
