# Week 1
In the  first week of our course, syllabus & structure of the course were discussed. And, apart from that there was a virtual meeting with clients of the projects where they talked about their requirement and expectation. Also, I learnt about different SDLCs in use and their significance.
# Week 2
In the second week, prototypes, design, and architecture of a software system were covered. Also, the participation in in-class activities such as creating wireframes was a great learning experience for me. Apart from these topics, tech stack of the project has also been discussed.
