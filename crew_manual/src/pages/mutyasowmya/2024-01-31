Reflections about the last modules:
In the last modules the architecture diagram, tech stacks, and prototypes.
Architecture communicates structure.

Architecture Diagram:
An architecture diagram is a graphical representation that illustrates the components and relationships within a system.
It helps stakeholders, including developers, architects, and project managers, to understand the design and structure of the system.
Tech Stacks (Technology Stack):
A technology stack refers to the combination of software, tools, and programming languages used to build and run a particular software application or system. 
This includes the operating system, web server, database, programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and other technologies. 
A tech stack is a crucial aspect of the architecture, as it defines the tools and technologies that will be employed to implement the system.
Prototypes:
Prototypes are early, often simplified versions of a system or a specific feature. 
In the context of architecture, a prototype might be a mock-up or a working model that demonstrates how certain aspects of the system will function. 
Prototypes are used for testing and validating design decisions before full-scale development begins.
