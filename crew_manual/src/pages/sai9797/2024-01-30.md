In this course in starting week we learned about the fundamental introduction of the subject. Gained knowledge of the software development life cycle and fundamental engineering concepts, setting a clear objective to provide clients with reliable, tested software. Three new projects were added to the curriculum: Material Donor Mutual Assist, Just a Second Chance Connector, and Research Asset Discovery. These additions made the lessons more engaging and applicable. Engaging with project stakeholders to comprehend needs gave your learning a more practical perspective.

Later learnt about the time management and teamwork abilities while diving deeper into prototyping. Within predetermined timeframes, structured assignments offered a platform for creativity, and peer review assisted in honing your concepts. The significance of setting priorities, communicating clearly, and adjusting to obstacles was stressed throughout the training. This knowledge is useful in abilities for upcoming artistic and group projects and equipping for difficulties in the software development industry.
