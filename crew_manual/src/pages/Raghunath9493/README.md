# Raghunath Kunigiri - Docker compose reflections

## Pre-requisites:
1. Docker_desktop setup should be done and it should be started and running.

## Assumptions:

The application is built using Flask and the main code is in app.py. Redis is used as the in-memory data store. 

A requirements.txt file contains the list of dependencies to be installed, such as Flask, Redis, and any other libraries used.

The application runs on port 8000. 

When deploying the application, the following steps would need to be taken:

1. Install Redis and start the Redis server.

2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from requirements.txt.

3. Run app.py to start the Flask development server on port 8000. 

4. Configure the application to connect to the Redis server.

5. Make any other necessary configurations for deployment, like setting environment variables. 

6. For production deployment, use a production-ready web server like Gunicorn instead of the Flask development server.

7. Configure the web server and application to run properly in production.


## Command to run docker compose file:
 docker compose up

1) Docker provides containerization, allowing multiple containers to run isolated from each other on a single host. This is useful for developing and deploying the Flask application with its Redis dependency. 
2) A Dockerfile defines the environment and commands to build a Docker image. This image can then be used to create containers. For the Flask app, the Dockerfile would install Python, copy the app code, install dependencies, expose the port, etc. 
3) Docker-compose is used to define and run multi-container applications. A docker-compose.yml file defines the different services/containers such as Flask and Redis. It allows starting up the whole application with one command instead of individual containers.
4) The docker-compose.yml here could define a Flask service building from the Dockerfile and a Redis service using a standard Redis image. It links these together and configures networking and ports.
5) This setup allows quick onboarding for new developers, simple environment replication across environments, and automated testing/CI pipelines. Containers built locally can be deployed to staging/production clusters.
6) At scale, container orchestration systems like Kubernetes can be used to manage containers across multiple hosts. But docker-compose is useful for local development and testing of the Flask and Redis application.

## Git-hub actions docker compose file:
This file has the workflow for the github actions to build, test and copy the test results. Assuming that this would automate the process. The same can be used for production as well.
