ASSUMPTIONS:

The image referenced in the Docker Compose YAML file is a placeholder and does not represent the original image intended for our project. 
Currently, a sample image available in Docker is being used.
As the project progresses and undergoes further development, I plan to replace this placeholder image with the actual image relevant to our project. 
This substitution will accurately reflect the nature and specifics of our application.
