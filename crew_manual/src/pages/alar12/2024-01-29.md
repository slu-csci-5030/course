### The module provided a valuable experience in understanding the essence of work. It was enjoyable to generate ideas and create prototypes, engaging in a hands-on approach. Balancing creativity with technical aspects posed some challenges, but it all fell into place when I realized the practical application of what we learned in real project scenarios. Overall, the combination of creativity and technical skills was well-explored and applied throughout the module.
