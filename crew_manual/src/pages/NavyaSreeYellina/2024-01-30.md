### **Week 1**
In the first week, I was introduced to the fundamental concepts and goals of this software development course. I grasped the core objectives - understanding the software development life cycle and key engineering principles

The overarching goal became clear - deliver robust, tested software to customers. Learning about the three projects we will be working on - Research Asset Discovery, Just a Second Chance Connector, and Material Donor Mutual Assist - made things more tangible and exciting. Interacting with project stakeholders to understand requirements was insightful.

### **Week2**
During the second week, I dove deeper into the software development life cycle phases - planning, requirements gathering, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Gaining a nuanced understanding of each step gives me an appreciation for the complexities of software creation.

Additionally, architectural concepts and technology stack overviews equipped me with a broader perspective. We compared different architectures and their trade-offs, crucial knowledge as these structural choices profoundly impact software projects.

### **Overall Reflections**

In summary, the first two weeks provided a robust launch pad for my software development learnings. With clear course objectives, hands-on project experience, and a growth mindset, I feel prepared to take on the challenges and opportunities ahead on this dynamic career path.
