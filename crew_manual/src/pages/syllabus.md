* **Policy on late or missing work/exams:**
  * Any assignments that are submitted on-time may be revised through the end of the course for up to full credit provided the work received at least a score of 70%. In other words, if you submit an assignment on time that is passing, you may resubmit revisions for a higher grade. 
    * Revisions must be completed at least 2 days before the next assignment begins in order to receive full credit for the assignment.
    * Revisions submitted after 2 days before the next assignment begins can contribute to up to 50% of any missing points.
    * Work on code must be submitted as additional commits in GitLab with a comment that includes `[REV]` indicating the intention to do additional work on a particular assignment.
    * For example:
      * An "Pillowbox" assignment is due Monday the 1st of the month, and attempt submitted on Monday the 1st of the month recieves 75% of total possible points.
      * The next assignment is due the following Monday the 8th of the month.
      * A commit is made on Wednesday the 3rd with the commit message `[REV] updates to Pillowbox to fix gaps in fidget wrinkler`, some improvement is included in the update and the grade is changed to 82%.
      * A commit is made on Friday the 5th with the commit message `fix some Pillowbox bugs`, no change in the grade.
      * A commit is made on Tuesday the 9th with the message `[REV] fix all remaining Pillowbox bugs`; all requirements set in the rubric are met, and the final grade is changed to 91% (50% of the remaining 18 possible points.) 

  * We all have busy lives, and sometimes life creates delays. Software is a team activity, and your actions have implications for other people’s busy schedules. After three late assignments any subsequent late assignments will automatically have 10% of the possible total deducted from the score for each day they are late.  

  * Group projects submitted after the posted deadline will be considered late, and will automatically have the late policy applied.

  * Any missing work will automatically be assigned a score of 0.

## Attendance

Regular attendance is expected, and required to pass this class.

Expectations for student attendance/presence in this course follow the University policy on attendance at <https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/academic-policies-procedures/attendance>

Please talk with or e-mail the instructor if you need to miss class for reasons outside of those listed in the University policy “Authorized Absence Activities” section.

Each unexcused absence will result in an automatic 5 point deduction from final exams.

Students are expected to communicate with the instructor and their team(s) as early as possible if they are unable to attend, or will be more than 5 minutes late to any planned group activity such as classes. Each failure to communicate in a timely fashion will result in 5 point deduction from final exams.

## Academic Integrity 

Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is “the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.” Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service through which SLU fulfills its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern. The full University-level Academic Integrity Policy can be found on the Provost's Office website at: https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf. 
 
The School of Science and Engineering has its own academic integrity policies that is applicable in this course.

This course involves a significant amount of group work. Each student working in a group must be able to clearly identify and explain their contributions on the team effort. 

## Policy Changes

* Course policies may change at any point during the course.
* Course policy changes may be proposed by students.
* A best effort will be made to obtain input from students on possible changes.
* All changes must be approved by the instructor of record for the course.
* Changes to policy are effective once they have been posted (in Canvas).
* Changes to policy will only apply to course work and sessions after changes are posted for the entire class.
* Updates to university policies supersede existing course policies.
* Unforseen circumstances requiring a change in normal university operations supersede existing course policies.

## Disability Accommodations 

Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must formally register their disability with the University. Once successfully registered, students also must notify their course instructor that they wish to use their approved accommodations in the course. 

Please contact the Center for Accessibility and Disability Resources (CADR) to schedule an appointment to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Most students on the St. Louis campus will contact CADR, located in the Student Success Center and available by email at <accessibility_disability@slu.edu> or by phone at <314.977.3484>. Once approved, information about a student’s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors by email from CADR and within the instructor’s official course roster. Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one also are encouraged to contact to CADR. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries.

**Note: due to accreditation requirements, regulatory differences, and/or location-specific resources, the School of Law, the School of Medicine, and SLU Madrid have their own standard language for syllabus statements related to disability accommodations. Faculty in those units should seek guidance for syllabus requirements from their dean’s office.**

## Title IX 

Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, stalking, domestic or dating violence, we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident that involves a Title IX matter, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX Coordinator and share the basic facts of your experience. This is true even if you ask the faculty member not to disclose the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.

Anna Kratky is the Title IX Coordinator at Saint Louis University (DuBourg Hall, room 36; <anna.kratky@slu.edu>; <314-977-3886>). If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK or make an anonymous report through SLU’s Integrity Hotline by calling 1-877-525-5669 or online at <http://www.lighthouse-services.com/slu>.

Note: due to accreditation requirements, regulatory differences, and/or location-specific resources, the School of Law, the School of Medicine, and SLU Madrid have their own standard language for syllabus statements related to Title IX. Faculty in those units should seek guidance for syllabus requirements from their dean’s office.

## Face Masks (until further notice)

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, key safeguards like face masks have allowed SLU to safely maintain in-person learning. If public health conditions and local, state, and federal restrictions demand it, the University may require that all members of our campus community wear face masks indoors. 

Therefore, any time a University-level face mask requirement is in effect, face masks will be required in this class. This expectation will apply to all students and instructors, unless a medical condition warrants an exemption from the face mask requirement (see below). 


*_When a University-wide face mask requirement is in effect_*, the following will apply:
* Students who attempt to enter a classroom without wearing masks will be asked by the instructor to put on their masks prior to entry. Students who remove their masks during a class session will be asked by the instructor to resume wearing their masks. 
* Students and instructors may remove their masks briefly to take a sip of water but should replace masks immediately. The consumption of food will not be permitted.
* Students who do not comply with the expectation that they wear a mask in accordance with the University-wide face mask requirement may be subject to disciplinary actions per the rules, regulations, and policies of Saint Louis University, including but not limited to those outlined in the Student Handbook. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including any of the following:
  * dismissal from the course(s)
  * removal from campus housing (if applicable)
  * dismissal from the University
* To immediately protect the health and well-being of all students, instructors, and staff, instructors reserve the right to cancel or terminate any class session at which any student fails to comply with a University-wide face mask requirement.  

*_When a University-wide face mask requirement is not in effect_*, students and instructors may choose to wear a face mask or not, as they prefer for their own individual comfort level.


*ADA Accommodations for Face Mask Requirements*
Saint Louis University is committed to maintaining an inclusive and accessible environment. Individuals who are unable to wear a face mask due to medical reasons should contact the Office of Disability Services (students) or Human Resources (instructors) to initiate the accommodation process identified in the University’s [ADA Policy](https://www.slu.edu/human-resources/pdfs/policies/americans-disabilities-act-policy.pdf). Inquiries or concerns may also be directed to the [Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity](https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel/institutional-equity-diversity/index.php). Notification to instructors of SLU-approved ADA accommodations should be made in writing prior to the first class session in any term (or as soon thereafter as possible).

## In-Person Class Attendance and Participation (until further notice)

The health and well-being of SLU’s students, staff, and faculty are critical concerns, as is the quality of our learning environments.  Accordingly, the following University policy statements on in-person class attendance are designed to preserve and advance the collective health and well-being of our institutional constituencies and to create the conditions in which all students have the opportunity to learn and successfully complete their courses.

1.	Students who exhibit any potential COVID-19 symptoms (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) shall absent themselves from any in-person class attendance or in-person participation in any class-related activity until they have been evaluated by a qualified medical official.  Students should contact the University Student Health Center for immediate assistance.  

2.	Students (whether exhibiting any of potential COVID-19 symptoms or not, and regardless of how they feel) who are under either an isolation or quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official must absent themselves from all in-person course activities per the stipulations of the isolation or quarantine directive.  

3.	Students are responsible for notifying their instructor of an absence as far in advance as possible; when advance notification is not possible, students are responsible for notifying each instructor as soon after the absence as possible. Consistent with the University Attendance Policy, students also are responsible for all material covered in class and must work with the instructor to complete any required work. In situations where students must be absent for an extended period of time due to COVID-19 isolation or quarantine, they also must work with the instructor to determine the best way to maintain progress in the course as they are able based on their health situation. 

4.	Consistent with the University Attendance Policy, students may be asked to provide medical documentation when a medical condition impacts a student’s ability to attend and/or participate in class for an extended period of time. 

5.	As a temporary amendment to the current University Attendance Policy, all absences due to illness or an isolation/quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official, or due to an adverse reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine, shall be considered “Authorized” absences
