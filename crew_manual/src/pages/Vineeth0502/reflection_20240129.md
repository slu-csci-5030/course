# Reflection Log - Previous Modules

## Date: 2024-01-29

### Overview

Previous modules were cool! They made me learn so much how do projects are born and grow. How to find them and talk with clients through creating prototypes, designing structures and brainstorms together - everything here.

### Important Points

1. Working Together: I loved the way we all will work together. The idea sharing, feedbacks make our work way better and felt like working as a team.

2. Speaking Clearly: Being able to speak well was very important. Whether it had to do with our team or clients, being able to communicate clearly allowed us to be able to understand each other and avoid any misunderstandings or miscommunications.

3. Understanding the Project: Exactly what was required of us for our project made the difference. The modules made it obvious that understanding our project properly enables good decision making.

4. Finishing on Time: As mentioned earlier, managing times of delivering tasks was quite tricky but crucial. When delivery times were met, deadlines implied planning well and the modules taught discipline in it.

### Reflection

The module was good, clearly explaining what studio work really meant. I enjoyed coming up with ideas and developing prototypes, this being more or less hands-on part. It was a little difficult in balancing creativity with technical stuff but it clicked when I saw how what we learned applies in real project cases.

### Feedback

The things were well explained by the Professor. Practical stuff was involved along with theories, and it made this learning experience fulsome. Working on real-world projects more and at least getting a chance to work for clients would be really phenomenal!

## Concluding thoughts

As these modules conclude, I'm taking away not just tech skills but the significance behind teamwork, communication clear and managing time. Made everything interesting with hands-on learning, and excited using these skills in the next module and keeping on getting better in software developments!
