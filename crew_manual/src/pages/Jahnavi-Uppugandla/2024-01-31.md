Value in Software Development:
Software development aims to create value.
Value is perceived differently from various perspectives, including users, developers, and customers.
Value can be functional, monetary, social, psychological, tangible, intangible, etc.
Measuring value requires asking questions, evaluating success, and understanding perceptions and inertia over time.

Software Development Lifecycle:
Iterative and incremental processes are fundamental to software development.
Iterative processes ensure continuous delivery of value.
Incremental processes manage work by building modular components that integrate gradually.
Iterative and incremental approaches complement each other.

Planning and Dynamic Nature:
Planful and dynamic approaches involve dealing with tasks and problems as they arise.
Waterfall represents a fully planned approach, while Agile emphasizes flexibility and adaptation.
Proximity impacts the software development lifecycle, and choosing appropriate levels of planning is essential.
Tooling and Intellectual Property:
Tooling choices impact the development process, with considerations for proprietary, open, and hybrid approaches.
Understanding intellectual property usage is crucial, especially concerning code repositories like GitHub.

Architecture:
Architecture involves high-level structural design and communication of software systems.
Effective architecture responds to context, balancing tradeoffs and addressing various factors.
Different architectures exist, each with strengths and weaknesses, tailored to specific needs.
Well-known architecture patterns provide solutions to common conditions and are documented using various diagrams.
Project Architectures and Tech Stacks:
Projects typically have specific architectures and tech stacks tailored to their requirements.
Tech stacks encompass various layers, including design, architecture, and infrastructure, using standardized technologies. 

i have learnt about these concepts in the previous classes .
 and i have learnt to make prototypes of the project briefings discussed.
