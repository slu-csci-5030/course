I do not feel that I learned an awful lot in the last module, but that is to be expected for multiple reasons:

1. I entered the class late and therefore had fewer class sessions in which to learn things.
2. It is the beginning of the class, so some of the class time and content will be necessarily dedicated to introducing the course and getting things set up.
