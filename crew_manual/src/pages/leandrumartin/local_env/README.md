## Assumptions

This uses Node 17 with React and Express.

## Reflections

Thanks to the Web Technologies class I had last year, I did not know anything about Docker or how to use it. I was left with no guidance on how to use it, despite it being a class that was supposed to teach me web technologies. This time around, however, I found a tutorial on how to use Docker by the YouTube channel Net Ninja which was very helpful. Combined with the pressue of a tighter deadline, I feel that I was able to complete the assignment adequately.
