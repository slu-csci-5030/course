## Assumptions

This uses Node 17 with React and Express.

## Reflections

I did not know anything about Docker or how to use it. However, I found a tutorial on how to use Docker by the YouTube channel Net Ninja which was very helpful. Combined with the pressue of a tight deadline, I feel that this helped me complete the assignment adequately. The process was not difficult when using this tutorial, especially as it used Node as an example, which I was planning to use for this assignment.
