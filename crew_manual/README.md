## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Overview

Here i created an express js application named dockerpractice-psd.

In the dockerpractice.psd folder(express application) i written Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, test.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml. All the files with application code is under the yrlmanoharreddy/dockerpractice.psd folder

However i written all the docker files separately under github username folder or under the same folder(yrlmanoharreddy)

## Docker can be created and run using the following command
    docker-compose up

## Please look into the yrlmanoharreddy/dockerpractice-psd, where i created application and done all the local set up 
For the starting of application:
 ## Docker File

Dockerfile is needed to write all the 

The Dockerfile sets up a Node.js environment using the node:21-alpine base image. It installs nodemon, copies project files (package.json, bin/www, etc.), and runs npm install to install dependencies. Port 3000 is exposed for external access, and the default command (npm start) launches the Node.js application. This Dockerfile streamlines containerization, ensuring a portable and consistent environment for running Node.js applications.

## docker-Compose.yml file

The Docker Compose file defines a service named dockerpractice-psd, specifying the build context and Dockerfile location. It maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on the host machine and sets the NODE_ENV environment variable to development. This file simplifies the deployment of the associated Dockerfile-based service, enabling consistent configuration and ease of management for the development environment.

## test.yml
The provided GitHub Actions workflow, named "Test," triggers on both push and pull request events occurring on the main branch. It defines a single job called "test" that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment. The job comprises steps: checking out the code, setting up Node.js version 14, installing dependencies via npm, and executing tests using npm. This workflow automates the testing process, ensuring code quality and consistency in the main branch of the repository.

## docker-compose.prod.yml
The provided Docker Compose file defines a service named dockerpractice-psd using the image dockerpracticee:1.0. It also specifies a build context and Dockerfile location for building the image. Port 3000 of the container is mapped to port 3000 on the host machine, and the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production. This configuration facilitates the deployment of the specified Dockerfile-based service, ensuring it runs in a production environment with the specified settings.mm
